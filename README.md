## How The Game Works

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player
is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The
player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying
speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides
with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start
square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
